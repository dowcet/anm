* Overview
A tool to scrape metadata for materials at the National Archives of Malaysia (ANM).

Barely tested and under construction, use at your own risk! 

The most useful function at the moment is "dump_search_to_csv". To use it:

1) [[http://ofa.arkib.gov.my/ofa/][Search manually]] for a list of records.
2) Save the list of records to an html file, e.g. result.html.
3) Call dump_search_to_csv("result.html")   

This will download the pages for each asset in your search results and parse their metadata to a spreadsheet, "assets.csv". 
* Features to add
