* Overview
A tool for scraping metadata for materials at the National Archives of Malaysia (ANM).

Barely tested and under construction, use at your own risk! 

The highest level function at the moment is "dump_from_search", which takes a URL or an html file of search results and outputs a dictionary of metadata for the hits in JSON format. There are some other special features incorporated if you look closely.  
* Features to add
** interactive document search
** output to CSV, biblatex
